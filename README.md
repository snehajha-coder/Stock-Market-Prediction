# Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis

## Overview
This repository presents a hybrid model for predicting stock prices by leveraging numerical analysis of historical stock prices and textual analysis of news headlines. The primary objective of this project is to develop an effective approach that combines both quantitative and qualitative factors to enhance stock price/performance prediction.

## Features
- Stock price data preprocessing
- Implementation of various machine learning models
- Evaluation of model performance
- Prediction visualization

## Requirements
- Python (version 3.9.16)
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - xgboost
  - nltk
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - tensorflow
  - keras

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/snehajha-coder/Stock-Market-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Preprocess the stock price data by running the preprocessing script:
   ```
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Train and evaluate the machine learning models by running the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
3. View the predictions and evaluation results in the output files or visualize them using the provided visualization script:
   ```
   python visualize.py
   ```

## Data
The dataset used for this project should be stored in the `data/` directory. It should contain historical stock price data in CSV format.

## Model Selection
You can experiment with different machine learning models by modifying the `main.py` script. The current implementation includes [list the models used].

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using [mention the evaluation metrics used, such as mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)].

## Results
The results of the stock price prediction, along with the evaluation metrics, can be found in the `results/` directory.
