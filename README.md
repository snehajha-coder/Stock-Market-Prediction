   - Adjust the machine learning models or algorithms as desired.
   - Modify the visualization code to suit your preferences.

4. Ensure that you have all the necessary libraries installed:
   - Install the required libraries by running the following command in a code cell:
     ```
     !pip install library_name
     ```
   - Replace "library_name" with the actual name of the library if it is not already installed.

5. Execute the code cells in the Jupyter Notebook to run the entire code or specific sections as needed:
   - Use the "Run" button or press "Shift + Enter" to execute a code cell.
   - Follow the instructions and prompts provided within the code for any user inputs or interactions.

6. View the output, predictions, and evaluation results directly in the Jupyter Notebook:
   - The output will be displayed in the output cells below the corresponding code cells.
   - Evaluate the performance of the models and analyze the predicted stock prices or performance.

7. Customize the code and experiment with different settings or approaches to further refine the predictions:
   - Modify the parameters of the machine learning models.
   - Try different feature engineering techniques or preprocessing methods.
   - Explore alternative algorithms or models to enhance the predictions.

8. Save your modifications and the output generated from the Jupyter Notebook for future reference and analysis.

Note: Ensure that you have the required dataset available and properly formatted before running the code. Modify the code and adapt it to your specific dataset and analysis objectives.

By following these steps and modifying the provided Jupyter Notebook code, you can leverage the stock market prediction functionality according to your specific needs and dataset.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Collection
Gather historical stock price data for the target stock from reliable sources such as financial APIs or databases.
Collect relevant news headlines or articles related to the target stock from news APIs or web scraping.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the historical stock price data by handling missing values, outliers, and adjusting for any stock splits or dividends.
Preprocess the textual data by removing unnecessary characters, converting to lowercase, and applying techniques like tokenization and stemming/lemmatization.

### 3. Numerical Analysis
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the historical stock price data to understand trends, patterns, and relationships.
Extract important features such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and other technical indicators.
Split the data into training and testing sets.

### 4. Textual Analysis
Perform sentiment analysis on the collected news headlines using techniques like Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Assign sentiment scores or labels (positive, negative, neutral) to each headline based on the sentiment analysis results.

### 5. Feature Integration
Combine the numerical features derived from the historical stock price data with the sentiment scores from the textual analysis.
Create a merged dataset that includes both numerical and textual features.

### 6. Model Training
Select a suitable machine learning algorithm such as regression, support vector machines, or neural networks.
Split the merged dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the machine learning model using the training data.

### 7. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or accuracy.
Fine-tune the model parameters if necessary to improve the performance.

### 8. Prediction and Analysis
Use the trained model to make predictions on the unseen data (testing set).
Analyze the predicted stock prices/performance and compare them with the actual values.
Evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the hybrid model in predicting stock prices/performance.

### 9. Iterative Improvement
Iterate and refine the model by incorporating additional data, adjusting feature selection, or trying different machine learning algorithms.
Continuously monitor and update the model as new data becomes available.

## Data
The dataset used for this project should be

 stored in the `data/` directory. It should contain historical stock price data in CSV format.

## Model Selection
You can experiment with different machine learning models by modifying the `main.py` script. The current implementation includes [list the models used].

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using [mention the evaluation metrics used, such as mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)].

## Results
The results of the stock price prediction, along with the evaluation metrics, can be found in the `results/` directory.
